# LiquidBounce Default Theme

This directory contains the source code of LiquidBounce's default theme made with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/).

## Development

**This development setup is temporary and will be improved in the future!**

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) on your computer (either latest or stable should be fine).
2. Install required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set `IN_DEV` in [host.ts](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/blob/nextgen/src-theme/src/integration/host.ts) to `true`.
4. Launch the client.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start a development server.

Make sure not to push the changes made to `host.ts` and `NettyServer.kt`!
