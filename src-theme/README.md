# LiquidBounce Official Theme

Welcome to the LiquidBounce Theme!
This is our default theme, which is being used in our minecraft hacked-client LiquidBounce.

## Roadmap

[GitHub Issue Roadmap](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/issues/1025)

### Concepts:

Our [Nextgen concepts](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/tree/nextgen/src-theme/concepts). They follow the same
design guidelines and can be found in the `src-theme\concepts` folder.

We use Adobe XD as a design tool, but you can also open find the concepts as a PNG file under the folder with the same
name.

- [x] Main Menu
- [x] Singleplayer
- [x] Multiplayer

- [x] Proxy Manager (https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/issues/391)
- [ ] Configuration (Scripts, Mods, Themes...)
- [ ] Marketplace (https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/issues/1024)
- [x] ClickGUI
- [x] ClickGUI search bar (https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/issues/800)
- [x] HUD

### Implementation

We are lacking Web DEVs, and therefore, the progress of implementing these design concepts into our client is a slow
progress.
If you are capable to work with Svelte and JS and have a good understanding of turning design concepts into HTML and
CSS, contact us on our support@liquidbounce.net email or on GitHub (the faster way).

## Building

To build the themes, you need to have Node.js and Python installed.
Then run `python build.py` to build the theme.

### Testing

To test the theme in development, you can make use of the development server using:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

and go into LiquidBounce and open the local web server using: \

```
.client ultralight show http://localhost:10004/clickgui/public/
```

This will show the page and automatically updates when you make changes to the source code.

### Release

This theme is directly linked to our client and is being updated with every release.
It will automatically be built and added to the client resources.

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this theme, you can do so by creating a pull request. \
We will review it, and if it fits our design guidelines, we will merge it.
