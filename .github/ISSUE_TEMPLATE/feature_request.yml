        üßê **Guidelines:**
        
        - Search through [existing issues](https://github.com/CCBlueX/LiquidBounce/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue) first to ensure that this feature has not been requested before.
        - Write a descriptive title for your issue. Avoid generic or vague titles such as "Some suggestions" or "Ideas for improvement".
        - Keep your issue focused on one single problem. If you have multiple feature requests, please create separate issues for each of them.
        - Provide as much context as possible in the details section. Include screenshots, screen recordings, links, references, or anything else you may consider relevant.
        - If you want to ask a question instead of requesting a feature, please use the [forum](https://forums.ccbluex.net/) instead.
