/**
 * Generates a list of [NbtCompound]s from a [SimpleInventory]
 *
 * These [NbtCompound]s can be used to recreate the inventory
 * using Minecraft Chests
 * by placing them together
 *
 * For example by typing this command:
 * give @p chest{display:{Name:"\"Hello!\""},BlockEntityTag:{Items:[{Slot:0,id:acacia_boat,Count:1}]}} 1
 *
 * This will give you a chest with the name "Hello!" and an acacia boat in the first slot
 * However, this will only work for the first 27 slots and not for the rest. This is why we split the
 *  inventory into multiple [NbtCompound]s
 *
 * There should also be [CommandChest] .chest <nbt> which will give you the chest with the given nbt
 *
 * @return A list of [NbtCompound]s representing the inventory
