     * A fix for old anti-cheats which check the packet order by 1.8 standards, while we are at 1.20+.
     *
     * interactItem() will always send an additional PlayerMoveC2SPacket, which will cause many anti-cheats to flag you.
     * This fix will remove the PlayerMoveC2SPacket, which will cause the anti-cheat
     * to think that the packet order is correct.
     * But it might cause the interact item use to be off by one tick, as the rotation was not updated in the same tick.
     *
     * Of course this is something to be fixed by the anti-cheat, but we cannot rely on that and have to fix it
     * ourselves.
