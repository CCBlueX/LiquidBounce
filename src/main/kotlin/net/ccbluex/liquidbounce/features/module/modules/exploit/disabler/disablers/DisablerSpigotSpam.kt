 * Spigot kicks people who spam messages.
 * There is an exclusion list, which by default includes /skill
 *
 * Bukkit only checks if your message starts with the exclusion, it
 * does not care if it's a command or not.
 * By illegally adding /skill to the start of our message and
 * not sending it as a command, we can bypass antispam.
