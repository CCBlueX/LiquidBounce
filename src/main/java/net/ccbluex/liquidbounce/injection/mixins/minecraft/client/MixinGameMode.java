     * In newer versions, that has been removed but replaced with a constant variable called DEFAULT which is equals to SURVIVAL.
     * However, this puts AntiBot to a disadvantage because it can't know what gamemode type the player/bot actually has.
     * <p>
     * With this injection though, this is no longer a problem.
